      <p>Hi, I'm Anna. I am in the Master's program in Human-Centered Design and Engineering. I don't have a lot of experience coding, 
      but I am excited to learn and practice in this class. My background is in Project and Event Management and my undergraduate degree 
      is in Marketing. Some of my interests include hiking, kayaking, and coffee drinking.
